⚙️Restaurant Cuisines Analysis

⭐The "Restaurant Cuisines Analysis" project explored various aspects of restaurant data, focusing on identifying patterns, trends, and insights related to cuisines, ratings, pricing, and service availability. 

⭐The project can be classified as an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. EDA involves analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

⭐Using tools like Pandas for data manipulation, Numpy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and Folium for geospatial visualisation, the project derived meaningful insights to inform business decisions.

⭐Key analyses included identifying the top three cuisines and their prevalence, determining the city with the highest number of restaurants and their average ratings, and visualising price range distributions. Logistic regression was used to compare ratings of restaurants offering online delivery versus those that don't. Decision trees and clustering techniques analysed rating distributions, while geospatial visualisation with Folium revealed restaurant location patterns.

⭐Restaurant chains were identified and analysed for ratings, with NLP applied to reviews to extract common keywords. Correlation analysis between the number of votes and ratings highlighted customer engagement's impact.

⭐The project provided comprehensive insights into restaurant performance and customer preferences, leveraging machine learning and visualisation techniques to inform strategic decisions in the restaurant industry.
